# Hackintosh-Thinkpad-L14-Gen-1
Not so knowledgeable MacOS Big Sur install on a Thinkpad L14 Gen 1

# Before Beginning
Be prepared to fight for a successful/stable install
You will have to do a lot of restarting and kext/ssdt injection to get things set up correctly. 

Please keep in mind that I did not build ANY of this setup on my own. I researched, attempted, and added to my setup from other github's of similar hackintosh builds. 
There were only 2 that I could find at the time of this writing. One, was more knowledgable but the USB mapping did not work will with my laptop. While USB worked, I have the mapping caused loading errors in my bluetooth (which is a known issue with incorrect USB mapping). 
It is HIGHLY recommended to do USB mapping in windows before going through the process of installing.
